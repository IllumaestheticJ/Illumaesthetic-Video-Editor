## From the 240SX scan reel (2026-11-10, built by an agent)
- **[match-cut]** Choose the cut frame by *scan state*, not by drama. The bumper-pull frame had no
  rigid landmarks in common with any scan (pop-up lights and hood moved between sessions).
- **[match-cut]** Landmarks on one flat face can't solve focal length (solver returned 193 mm).
  Spread points in depth (emblem + spoiler tips + mirror) or fix focal to the lens (iPhone 1×: 28 mm
  on a 20.25 mm-wide portrait sensor).
- **[match-cut]** Raycasts on panel seams fall through scan cracks to the far side of the car.
  Nudge picks off seams and re-project to verify.
- **[technical]** Changing ground cleanup re-normalises the scan and silently breaks camera solves.
  Pin the transform with `--like`.
- **[technical]** Full-car Artec STLs (25M tris) OOM Blender on 15 GB. Decimate out-of-core first.
- **[technical]** Rendering while npm/Chrome run in parallel took 6× longer. Serialise heavy jobs.
- **[scan-look]** House scan look is satin metallic silver on pure black (Temerario), not white clay.
- **[text]** HUD numbers must come from the data: 24,991,097 triangles (STL header), length
  4,527 mm (scan footprint; spec sheet says 4,520 mm — good sanity check).
- **[technical]** `type: cut` is a 1-frame xfade; without compensation each cut shifts everything after it
  1 frame earlier (8 cuts = 0.27 s off the music). The assembler now adds the frame back; always give
  clips an explicit `dur` from the beat grid.
- **[technical]** When trimming the clip that ends on the match frame, move `in`, never `out`.
- **[scan-look]** "Tighter" in 9:16 does not mean "whole car fills the width" - a full side profile at
  100 % width still reads small. Tighten by cropping into the car (3/4 views, side tracks that
  crop bumpers) and keep exploded parts from flying at the lens (move them down/back too).
- **[technical]** Splice part-state scans into the full car over the *smallest* zone that changed.
  Swapping half the car exposed coverage holes in the partial scan.
- **[text]** Before putting a claim like "inside + outside scanned" on screen, render the part from
  the hidden side and look. 240SX: true for front skin, rear skin, rear beam; the front crash beam only
  exists on the car (chassis scan), so it was not claimed.
- **[scan-look]** Showing a part's inside: flip it about its long (car-width) axis (`x180` in
  `--explode`), not a Z spin - a 1.6 m bumper spinning about Z sweeps into the car and the lens.
- **[story]** Ending on a product listing: if the listing's hero image is a render of the same scan,
  end the scan shot on that angle and dissolve - it reads as one object. 240SX v3.
- **[technical]** Parts spinning about Z need clearance from the body: stack them (one below, one above
  the car) instead of pulling straight out toward the lens.
- **[technical]** A dissolve overlaps clips like a cut does; lengthen the incoming clip by the dissolve
  duration or the video ends short of the music.
- **[audio]** Need more length than the track? Repeat whole bars between two measured onsets 8 beats
  apart with a 12 ms crossfade; check `ive beats` shows an unbroken grid across the splice.
